#### 1. Focus Area : <br>Instrumental and Practical Skills
The lab will focus on practical skills required in Java programming along with some demos for the same.<br>
#### Experimentation
The lab will focus on the process of develop java programming code including the syntax and methods used for override the method in java programs.
#### Learn from failure
The lab will docs on giving the advatage to the students to write malfuctioned code which will result in errors and then to rectify those errors by writing the correct generate.

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :  <u> Guided Inquiry 
###### Assessment Method: Summative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
The objectives along with the theory of java are already explained and given. The students are asked to propose a methodology for developing a java program based on the theory given, to address the objectives leading to results and conclusions.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. 
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:--
1.| Student will be able to describe the structure of method overriding using java. | Select the text editor for your java program. | Q • Which of these keywords can be used to prevent Method overriding? <br>a) static<br>b) constant<br>c) protected<br><b>d) final</b>
2.| Student will be able to identify different components of a java program.| Demonstrate the working of how to override method in program. | Q • Which of these is supported by method overriding in Java? <br>a) Abstraction<br>b) Encapsulation<br><b>c) Polymorphism</b><br>d) None of the mentioned
3.| Student will be able to develop a basic java program to display any text.| Construct a java program for displaying given output. | Q • Run time polymorphism is also known as <br><b>a) Method Overriding</b><br>b) Method Overloading<br>c) Method Rewriting<br>d) None of these

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Click Start Experiment Button in Preview Tab to start the experiment. | Simulator will display the Step 1 for understanding and creating java program. | To let student understand the procedure for performing the experiment.<br/>
2.| Click Next Button to insert code for Step 1 in Syntax section of Preview Tab.  | Add the syntax of the code for Step 1 in Syntax section of Preview Tab. | To allow student inserting Step 1 code in Syntax section after understanding it.<br/>
3.| Subsequently Click the Add Button for inserting the codes for further steps in Syntax Section of the Preview Tab.  | Add code in Syntax section accordingly for the further steps performed by the student.   | To allow student inserting codes for different steps in Syntax section after understanding<br/>
4.| Click the Execute Button after understanding all the steps of the program to execute the program.  | Show the output of program given in Simulator section of Preview Tab. | To execute program so that output of the program can be viewed in Output section. <br/>
5.| Click the Editor Tab for inserting his or her own code in Write Code section of Editor. | Provide the pre written program to the student for the reference. | To allow student to write their own code in Write Code Section of Editor Tab.<br/>
6.| Click the Run Code Button to see the output of code, in Output Section of Editor Tab. | Show the output of the code inserted by student and highlight the errors if any. | To execute code inserted by student and show its output in Output Section of the Editor and simultaneously show the errors done by student..<br/>
7.| Use Clear Screen Button to clear the screen of the simulator. | Clear the screen of the simulator.  | To allow student to insert a new code to experiment with and see the corresponding output. <br/>
